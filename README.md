Choose Color
============

This Vim extension allows you to open the Mac OS X Color Picker from inside Vim, and insert
the selected color in hexadecimal (CSS) format.

It defines a single command:

    :ChooseColor

It is recommended that you map this command to a shortcut of your choosing.

It is based on the [ColorX script][http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3014] by Maximilian Nickel.
